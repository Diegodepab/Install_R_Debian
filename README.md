# Install_R_Ubuntu
For academic reasons I have created various virtual machines, in which I am working in Linux, it will be easier for me to copy commands through this repository, initially it will be a way to install R and Rstudio in Linux environments, specifically Debian 12

Installing Ubuntu
-  **Download Ubuntu ISO** Go to the Ubuntu website and download the latest ISO file. (https://ubuntu.com/download) 
-  **Create a Bootable USB** Use a tool like Rufus (Windows) or Etcher (Mac/Linux) to create a bootable USB drive with the downloaded ISO.
-  **Boot from USB** Insert the USB drive into your computer and restart it. Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing F2, F12, Del, or Esc during startup) and set the USB drive as the primary boot device.
-  **Install Ubuntu** Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu. You can choose to install it alongside your existing OS or replace it.
